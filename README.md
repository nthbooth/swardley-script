# swardley-script
A fork of a prototype of a way to script wardley maps as code. 

Converts a simple map recorded as a JSON object into a conventional visual form as and SVG in a simple html file

This fork adds in arrows and coloured circles and a few other bits and bobs.. 

Mapping subfolder contains a small app that pulls the json from another location using the ?url= this allows you to pull the json from a google sheet or other location..
